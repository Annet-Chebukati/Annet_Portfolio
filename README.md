## [Project 1 : Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression : Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/%20Car%20Price%20Prediction%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
In this notebook we will predict car price and explore the methods we use to interpret and evaluate the results of our linear regression model.The following actions will be done;

- Assess the data.
- Build a basic linear regression model using a few selected features and run the model summary.
- Build a full linear regression model using a full range of features available to us.
- Plot a correlation matrix and perform feature engineering by reducing the number of independent variables we have.
- Perform one-hot Encoding on categorical variables.
- Split data into train and test sets, fit model to training data and perform test set predictions.
- Print summary output of the model, select variables that are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) and retrain the model.
- Scale our independent variables and fit the model with our standardized data.
- Evaluate the Linear Regression model.

## [Project 2 : Predicting Credit Card Approval - Classification Model : Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approval%20-%20Classification.ipynb)

 Build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques
- First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
- We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
- We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
- After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
- Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

##[Project 3 : Google Play Store Apps and Reviews : Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Google%20Play%20Store%20apps%20and%20reviews.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
