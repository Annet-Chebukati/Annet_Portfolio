## [Project 1 : Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression : Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)
In this notebook we will predict car price and explore the methods we use to interpret and evaluate the results of our linear regression model.The following actions will be done;

- Assess the data.
- Build a basic linear regression model using a few selected features and run the model summary.
- Build a full linear regression model using a full range of features available to us.
- Plot a correlation matrix and perform feature engineering by reducing the number of independent variables we have.
- Perform one-hot Encoding on categorical variables.
- Split data into train and test sets, fit model to training data and perform test set predictions.
- Print summary output of the model, select variables that are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) and retrain the model.
- Scale our independent variables and fit the model with our standardized data.
- Evaluate the Linear Regression model.
